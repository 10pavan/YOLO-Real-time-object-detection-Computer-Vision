# YOLO-Real-time-object-detection-Computer-Vision
Introduction
      
This project aims to do real-time object detection through a laptop camera or webcam using OpenCV. The idea is to loop over each frame of the video stream, detect objects like person, chair, dog, etc. and bound each detection in a box
